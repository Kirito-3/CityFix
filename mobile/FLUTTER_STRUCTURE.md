## 2. Core Architectural Subsystems

### A. Reactive State Management with Riverpod
We leverage **Riverpod's StateNotifierProvider** to decouple business logic from UI rendering:
* **Single Source of Truth:** Screens reactively watch (`ref.watch`) provider states (e.g. `authProvider` or `complaintProvider`). State modifications are executed strictly through notifiers (`ref.read(authProvider.notifier).login(...)`).
* **Immutability:** States are strictly immutable wrappers modified using copy-constructor conventions (`state = state.copyWith(...)`) to prevent side-effects across widgets.

### B. Network Layer (ApiClient & Secure Storage)
* **Dio Client Integration:** The centralized `ApiClient` instance handles timeouts and JSON headers. It injects a request interceptor that reactively extracts saved JWT tokens from `SecureStorageService.instance.readToken()` and appends them to authorization headers on every outbound HTTP request.
* **Brilliant 401 Session Eviction:** If an API endpoint replies with a `401 Unauthorized` (e.g., token expired), the Dio interceptor dynamically catches the error, deletes the saved credentials, and calls a static callback `ApiClient.onUnauthorized?.call()`. This callback is mapped by the `AuthNotifier` to instantly reset the auth state and redirect the GoRouter context to `/login`.

### C. GoRouter Guardians & Redirections
The navigation layer utilizes **GoRouter** to enforce route restrictions reactively based on the user's login state:
1. **Protected Paths Guard:** GoRouter watches `authProvider`. If the state resolves to unauthenticated, GoRouter intercepts the route request and redirects the user to `/login`.
2. **Backward Redirect Guard:** If the user is logged in, GoRouter intercepts attempts to visit `/login` or `/signup` and routes them directly to `/dashboard`.
3. **Frictionless Splash Boot:** On first load, `/` runs. The `SplashScreen` boots, reads `SecureStorage` for pre-existing JWTs, boots the user session reactive state, and transitions seamlessly to the dashboard or login screen after the logo animation finishes.

## 3. High-Performance API Integration Strategies

### Multipart FormData Image Uploads
Filing a complaint requires submitting coordinate strings and multiple binary files.
Our `ComplaintNotifier` translates this complex operation into a single high-performance `multipart/form-data` request:
```dart
final Map<String, dynamic> formMap = {
  'title': title,
  'description': description,
  'category': category,
  'longitude': longitude.toString(), // cast to string for multipart
  'latitude': latitude.toString(),
  'address': address,
};

final formData = FormData.fromMap(formMap);

// Append picked files dynamically
for (final path in localImagePaths) {
  formData.files.add(
    MapEntry(
      'images',
      await MultipartFile.fromFile(path, filename: path.split('/').last),
    ),
  );
}

final response = await _dio.post('/complaints', data: formData);
```
This is fully aligned with the backend **Zod preprocessors** which cast string-numbers back to float values!

## 4. Reusable Foundational UI Elements

Consistent styling and standard feedback shapes are backed by custom widgets in `widgets/foundations.dart`:
* **`CustomTextField`:** Wraps forms and input decors, providing custom icons, validation regexes, and security password show/hide icons.
* **`CustomButton`:** Features built-in elevated buttons configured with theme parameters. Automatically renders a circular loading indicator when state is loading.
* **`CustomLoader` / `CustomErrorWidget`:** Standardized full-screen loaders and stylized error cards containing built-in retry callback triggers.

---

## 5. Real-Time Socket.IO Subsystems & Timelines

To enable an instant reactive civic experience, the application orchestrates a dedicated WebSocket layer:
* **`SocketService` Gateway:** Intercepts WebSocket handshakes securely by passing the authenticated JWT in the connection payload. Establishes robust auto-reconnect configurations.
* **`realtimeProvider` Orchestrator:** Reactively responds to `authProvider` lifecycle changes. Bootstraps connections upon citizen logins and subscribes them to their private room `user_${userId}` to display instant app-wide Material notifications.
* **`complaintDetailProvider` Live Timeline Sync:** Subscribes to the specific room `complaint_${id}` when details sheet is active. Dynamically catches status transitions (`status_changed`) and assignments (`authority_assigned`), inserting them in-memory to update the timeline stepper instantly with zero database query overhead.

## 6. Interactive Nearby Maps Feed Subsystem

To supply a premium geographic civic reporting grid, the map layout integrates specialized state loops:
* **Dynamic Camera Pan Throttling:** Camera movements center geodetic coordinate updates inside `liveMapStateProvider`. Updates are debounced by 600ms to prevent REST server floods.
* **Geospatial API Mapping:** Calls `GET /complaints` passing camera lat/lng and selected radius (translated from UI pill lists like 1km, 3km, 5km into distance meters) to query the database sphere index.
* **Derived Pin Builders:** `mapMarkerProvider` parses geodetic complaint records into Google Maps `Marker` sets. Translates category types and statuses into distinct color markers (hueBlue for Submitted, hueGreen for Resolved, etc.).
* **Preview Card Overlays:** Tapping a marker inserts the complaint in `selectedMapComplaintProvider`. The UI reactively slides up an animated overlay card at the bottom displaying a preview, with a deep-link action guiding users directly into timeline logs.
